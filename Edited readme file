# Technical_Writing-
Creating a `README.md` file is a great way to explain your project to others (and your future self). It typically includes the purpose of the project, how to install and use it, and any other important info.

Here’s a **basic guide and example** to help you make one.

## ✅ Steps to Create a README File

1. **Open a text editor or IDE** (e.g., VS Code).
2. **Create a new file** and name it `README.md`.
3. Use **Markdown syntax** (which uses `#` for headings, `-` for lists, etc.).
4. Save the file in the **root folder** of your project.

- Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code blocks.
- Use `-` or `*` for bullet points.
- Include badges, screenshots, or demo links if possible.
